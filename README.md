### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. Thanks for checking out my github !!! It's much appreciated.

My name is Roman. I'm currently pursuing Masters degree in Data Science at University of Padua in Italy. I have obtained my bachelors specializing in Data Engineering. My fields of interest are machine learning, big data, backend and game development. 

I'm most proficient in python, but additionally know C/C++ and javascript and currently learning Rust to spice up my life a little bit. I know a variety of tools, libraries and frameworks for ML, Data Science and Software development in general (i.e Pytorch, MySQL, PostgresSQL, Git, Docker ...)

I can speak Russian, English and Polish. Also I'm currently learning Italian.

I'm trying to consistently commit to various personal repos (either projects i make myself or tutorial projects in a new language (i.e Rust)) to keep the skills sharp.
